						<i>&quot;The real Moon, if you could reach it and survive,</i><br>
						<i>would in a deep and deadly sense be just like anywhere else...</i><br>
						<i>No man would find an abiding strangeness on the Moon</i><br>
						<i>unless he were the sort of man who could find it in his own back garden.&quot;</i>

					<h1>What is Expedition?</h1>
					<p>Expedition is a game about the human sense of wonder and discovery; it lets you take a group of men and 
					journey into the unknown, playing inside a detailed sandbox of the XV century where you will be able to roam the 
					world, discover, colonize and trade. The game doesn't reward you with a new discovery on every step, it instead 
					requires from you methodical mapping and cartographic exercise to find these hidden wonders..</p>
					<h1>&quot;The New World&quot; Scenario</h1>
					<p>In &quot;The New World&quot;, the first scenario available for Expedition, you become a XVth century Spanish explorer; 
					you have to stock up an expedition to the New World, travel there, and then found colonies in the name of the crown. 
					In your quest you will find marvelous places and face friendly and hostile natives throughout the New World seeking to 
					obtain their riches for your kingdom.</p>
					<h1>The Development Model</h1>
					<p>All in-development versions of Expedition are free to download; we encourage you to try it and contribute to the development 
					if you like it :) we have worked hard to take it to its current status, however... there's still a lot to do :)</p>
					<p>After studying and estimating the efforts required to finish the game, we realized that the only way to make Expedition a reality using resources from the Internet people (You, our main funding source) is to divide the project into several &quot;facets&quot;, in order to launch incremental versions playable on their own.</p>
					<p>We have divided the project into 18 facets, you can find more info about each of them below. You can also vote for your preferred facet and discuss the roadmap <a href = "http://roguetemple.com/forums/index.php?topic=1787.0" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
					<p>Your contributions are highly valued! Help us make this a reality</p>
