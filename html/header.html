					<b>What is Expedition?</b>
					<p>Expedition is a game about the human sense of wonder and discovery; it's about taking a group of men and journeying into the unknown, playing inside a detailed sandbox of the XV century where you will be able to roam the world, discover, colonize and trade.</p>
					<p>The game takes some elements from the roguelike genre: it's a single player turn based free form game where no two adventures are the same... each session evolves differently, providing the player with a different challenge every time.</p>
					<p>Expedition is a reality now, (please <a href = "http://slashware.net/blog/expedition-the-new-world/" target = "_blank">download the current version</a>); it's not just an ethereal dream, we have worked hard to take it to its current status, however... there's still a lot to do :)</p>
					
					<b>The "facets" development model</b>
					<p>After studying and estimating the efforts required to finish the game, we have realized that the only way to make Expedition a reality using resources from the Internet people (You, our main funding source) is to divide the project into several &quot;facets&quot;, in order to launch incremental versions playable on their own.</p>
					<p>We have divided the project into 18 facets, you can find more info about each of them below. You can also vote for your preferred facet and discuss the roadmap <a href = "http://roguetemple.com/forums/index.php?topic=1787.0" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
