						<i>&quot;The real Moon, if you could reach it and survive,</i><br>
						<i>would in a deep and deadly sense be just like anywhere else...</i><br>
						<i>No man would find an abiding strangeness on the Moon</i><br>
						<i>unless he were the sort of man who could find it in his own back garden.&quot;</i>

					<h1>What is Expedition?</h1>
					<p>Expedition is a game about the human sense of wonder and discovery; it's about taking a group of men and journeying into the unknown, playing 
					inside a detailed sandbox of the XV century where you will be able to roam the world, discover, colonize and trade.</p>
					<h1>&quot;The New World&quot; Scenario</h1>
					<p>The first scenario to be developed for Expedition is dubbed &quot;The New World&quot;; in this scenario you become a XVth century Spanish explorer, 
					you have to stock up an expedition to the New World, travel there, and then found colonies in the name of the crown. 
					In your quest you will find marvelous places and face friendly and hostile natives throughout the New World seeking 
					to obtain their riches for your kingdom.</p>
					<h1>Why will you like Expedition</h1>
					<p>In order to make exploring an interesting experience, Expedition properly meters out the discovery and exploration; 
					it does not just drop a map in your lap, but a map with &quot;Here be Dragons&quot;. The game doesn't reward you with a new discovery on every step, 
					it instead requires from you methodical mapping and cartographic exercise to find these hidden wonders.</p>
					<p>But it doesn't stop there. In order to have a successful journey, you'll have to deal with resource management - 
					you can't just wander aimlessly for days and bore yourself! You'll also have to master the ways of sailing, 
					dealing with the natives, colonial management, and even political relationships with the crown.</p>
										
					<p>The game takes some elements from the roguelike genre: it's a single player turn based free form game where no two adventures are the same... 
					each session evolves differently, providing the player with a different challenge every time.</p>
					
					<h1>The Development Model</h1>
					<p>Expedition is a reality now, (please download the current version :)) it's not just an ethereal dream, we have worked hard to take it to its current status, however... there's still a lot to do :)</p>
					<p>After studying and estimating the efforts required to finish the game, we have realized that the only way to make Expedition a reality using resources from the Internet people (You, our main funding source) is to divide the project into several &quot;facets&quot;, in order to launch incremental versions playable on their own.</p>
					<p>We have divided the project into 18 facets, you can find more info about each of them below. You can also vote for your preferred facet and discuss the roadmap <a href = "http://roguetemple.com/forums/index.php?topic=1787.0" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
					<p>Your contributions are highly valued! Help us make this a reality</p>
